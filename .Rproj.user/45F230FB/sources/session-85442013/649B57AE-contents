# spexvb
This is a package to performParameter Expanded Variational Bayes for Linear Regression
with High-dimensional Variable Selection and Spike-and-slab
Priors

## Installation
To install the package, please follow the code snippet below: 

```
library(devtools)
install_github("peterolejua/spexvb")
```

## Example
Here is an example for conducting analysis using spexvb: 

```
library(spexvb)
library(MOFAdata)
# load data from the  CLL study as provided in MOFAdata
# use methylation data, gene expression data and drug responses as predictors
CLL_data <- CLL_data[1:3]
CLL_data <- lapply(CLL_data,t)
CLL_data <- Reduce(cbind, CLL_data)

#only include patient samples profiles in all three omics
CLL_data <- CLL_data[apply(CLL_data,1, function(p) !any(is.na(p))),]
dim(CLL_data)

# prepare design matrix and response
X <- CLL_data[,!grepl("D_002", colnames(CLL_data))]
Y <- rowMeans(CLL_data[,grepl("D_002", colnames(CLL_data))])

# rescaling
X_means <- colMeans(X)
X_c <- scale(X, center = X_means, scale = F)
sigma_estimate <- sqrt(colMeans(X_c^2)) 
X_cs <- scale(X, center = F, scale = sigma_estimate)

Y_mean <- mean(Y)
Y_c <- Y - Y_mean

seed <- 17
set.seed(seed)

fit_spexvb <- cv.spexvb.fit(
      k = 5,
      X = X_cs, # design matrix
      Y = Y_c, # response vector
      # Calculate the initials for each of the 10 folds
      mu = NULL, # Variational Normal mean estimated beta coefficient from lasso,  posterior expectation of bj|sj = 1
      omega = NULL, # Variational probability, expectation that the coefficient from lasso is not zero, the posterior expectation of sj
      c_pi = NULL, # π ∼ Beta(aπ, bπ), known/estimated
      d_pi = NULL, # π ∼ Beta(aπ, bπ), known/estimated
      tau_e = NULL, # errors iid N(0, tau_e^{-1}), known/estimated
      update_order = NULL,
      mu_alpha = 1, # alpha is N(mu_alpha, (tau_e*tau_alphalpha)^{-1}), known/estimated
      tau_alpha = c(0,10^(3:7)),
      tau_b = 400, # initial. b_j is N(0, (tau_e*tau_b)^{-1}), known/estimated
      intercept = F,
      max_iter = 500L,
      tol = 1e-5,
      seed = 17 # seed for cv.glmnet initials
    )  # Run the fit function
    
spexvb_beta <- fit_spexvb$mu * fit_spexvb$omega/sigma_estimate
plot(spexvb_beta)
